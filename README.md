# SVault.js

This repo is a fork of [toddmotto/vault](https://github.com/toddmotto/vault)

It's only change is to support sVault, which stores in Window.sessionStorage, instead of the original localStorage.

Why: using session storage enables multiple instances of your browser app to exist in multiple browser tabs.
Using localStorage means that the multiple tabs share the same data set. 

Below is from the orginal Readme, but `vault` has been updated to `sVault` and other changes to reflect 
this repo's use of sessionStorage.

Vault is a 0.4KB standalone `sessionStorage` API with automatic JSON support. The HTML5 spec permits sessionStorage to only accept a String as value of an Object property, SVault makes it possible to store entire JavaScript Objects. SVault uses a faster Object lookup than the suggested API methods.

IE8 supports sessionStorage, therefore SVault can be used with IE8+, but note browser storage limitations in IE8 compared to modern browsers.

### Storing Objects
SVault allows you to automatically store JavaScript Objects and not just strings (default localStorage behaviour), allowing you to do the following:

```javascript
var blink182 = {
  founded: '1992',
  formed: 'California',
  members: ['Tom Delonge', 'Mark Hoppus', 'Travis Barker']
};
svault.set('someBand', blink182);
```

### set API
To set data into localStorage, you must use the `set()` API. There are two arguments, `key` for the Object's key, and `value` for the key value:

```javascript
vault.set(key, value);
```

Example:

```javascript
// localStorage, object key = name, value = 'Tom Delonge'
vault.set('name', 'Tom Delonge');
```

### get API
Obtaining set data is easy with the `get()` API, simply reference a previously set key with `key`:

```javascript
vault.get(key);
```

Example:

```javascript
// getting 'name' from localStorage
// returns 'Tom Delonge'
vault.get('name');
```

### remove API
Removing set data is easy with the `remove()` API, again reference a previously set key with `key`:

```javascript
vault.remove(key);
```

Example:

```javascript
// removes 'name' from localStorage
vault.remove('name');
```

### empty API
It's a good idea to empty the user's localStorage when possible to avoid overloading it, there are limits which differ per browser. Specifically modern browsers allow around `5MB` but IE versions are limited. IE8 also supports localStorage and Vault.

```javascript
vault.empty();
```

## Installing with Bower
To install Vault into your project using Bower, use the GitHub repository hook:

```
bower install https://github.com/toddmotto/vault.git
```

## Manual installation
Drop your files into your required folders, make sure you're using the files from the `dist` folder, which is the compiled production-ready code. Ensure you place the script before the closing `</body>` tag so the DOM tree is populated when the script runs.
	
```html
<body>
	<!-- html content above -->
	<script src="dist/vault.js"></script>
  <script>
  vault.set('name', 'Tom Delonge');
  </script>
</body>
```

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using Gulp.
